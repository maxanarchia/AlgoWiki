long_description: "<p>Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm based on the <strong>divide and conquer</strong> paradigm.</p>

<p>It works by selecting a <em>pivot</em> element and partitioning the array such that elements less than the pivot go to its left and elements greater go to its right. Then, it recursively sorts the two partitions.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a pivot element</li>
  <li>Partition the array around the pivot</li>
  <li>Recursively sort the sub-arrays</li>
</ol>

<p>Although the worst case is <code>O(n^2)</code>, this can be avoided using randomized pivots or techniques like median-of-three. It is in-place and generally faster than Merge Sort for average cases.</p>"

curiosities: Quick Sort was developed by Tony Hoare in 1960 and is still considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice.
