long_description: "<p>Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the <strong>divide and conquer</strong> paradigm.
The core idea is to recursively divide the array into two halves, sort each half,
and then merge the two sorted halves.</p>

<p>The merging process is the fundamental part of the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Divide the array into two halves</li>
  <li>Recursively sort each half</li>
  <li>Merge the two sorted halves</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach guarantees a time complexity of <code>O(n log n)</code> in all cases
(best, average, and worst), making it highly efficient for large datasets.</p>

<p>Merge Sort is particularly useful when the data to be sorted does not fit entirely in main memory
and must be handled using external memory (external sorting).</p>"

curiosities: Merge Sort was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It was on of the first sorting algorithms to be implemented on a computer.
