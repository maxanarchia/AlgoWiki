long_description: "<p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level.</p>

<p>It uses a queue to keep track of the next vertex to visit, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start from a source vertex</li>
  <li>Visit all its neighbors</li>
  <li>Then visit the neighbors’ neighbors, and so on</li>
</ol>

<p>BFS guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in unweighted graphs.</p>"

curiosities: BFS is often used in AI, network analysis, and solving puzzles like the Rubik’s Cube.
