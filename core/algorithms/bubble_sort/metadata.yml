long_description: "<p>Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</p>

<p>The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements bubble to the top of the list with each pass.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compare adjacent elements</li>
  <li>Swap if needed</li>
  <li>Repeat until the list is sorted</li>
</ol>

<p>While it is easy to understand and implement, Bubble Sort is inefficient on large datasets.
However, it can be optimized to detect if the array is already sorted.</p>"

curiosities: Despite being one of the least efficient sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort is often taught for its educational value and simplicity.
