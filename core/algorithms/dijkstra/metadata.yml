long_description: "<p>Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem for graphs with non-negative edge weights.</p>

<p>It maintains a set of vertices with known shortest distances and iteratively expands this set using a greedy approach.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initialize distances and priority queue</li>
  <li>Pick the vertex with the smallest tentative distance</li>
  <li>Update distances to its neighbors</li>
  <li>Repeat until all vertices are processed</li>
</ol>

<p>Using a priority queue (e.g., a min-heap) makes the algorithm more efficient on sparse graphs.</p>"
