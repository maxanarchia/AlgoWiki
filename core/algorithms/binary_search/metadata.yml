long_description: "<p>Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a <strong>sorted array</strong>.</p>

<p>It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compare the target with the middle element</li>
  <li>If equal, return the index</li>
  <li>If less, repeat on the left half</li>
  <li>If greater, repeat on the right half</li>
</ol>

<p>It is extremely fast with a time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> but only applicable to sorted collections.</p>"

curiosities: Binary search is deceptively simple but easy to get wrong when implemented manually; many historical bugs arose from incorrect mid-point calculations.
